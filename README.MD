## Architecture Overview

This project follows a client-server architecture.

- **Server:** The backend is a RESTful API responsible for business logic, database interactions, and user authentication. It's built with **Node.js** and **Express**.
- **Client:** The frontend is a dynamic Single-Page Application (SPA) that provides the user interface and consumes the server's API. It's built with **React**.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

- Node.js (v18.x or newer)
- npm (v9.x or newer) or Yarn
- MongoDB

Verify installations:
```sh
node -v && npm -v && mongod --version
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2.  **Install Server Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install # or yarn install, pip install -r requirements.txt, etc.
    ```

3.  **Install Client Dependencies**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

## Running the Application

### Server

1.  Navigate to the `server` directory.
2.  Create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` and add your environment variables (database connection string, JWT secret, etc.).
3.  Start the development server.

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

### Client

1.  Navigate to the `client` directory.
2.  Start the client development server.

```bash
cd client
npm start # or yarn start
```

The client will be running on `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) and will connect to the server.

## API Documentation

The API documentation can be found here or is available through a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI at the `/api-docs` endpoint once the server is running.

## Configuration

Details about environment variables or configuration files for both client and server. For example:

- `PORT`: The port the server runs on.
- `MONGO_URI`: The connection string for the database.
- `REDIS_URL`: The connection string for the redis.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: The secret used to sign JWT tokens.
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`: The secret used to sign JWT tokens.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL`: The TTL for the access token.
- `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`: The TTL for the refresh token.

## Deployment

Provide instructions on how to deploy the application. Mention platforms like Heroku, Vercel, AWS, etc.
